SimpleBinaryEncoding(sbe) and netty client/server usage example project

Welcome to the sbe-netty-tcp-example wiki!

This is a a tutorial project about learn and explain how to use TCP raw socket IPC(Inter Process Communication) by using
netty. Started to the project with latest stable netty version (4.1.86.Final).

After investigate all the netty simple tutorials on web, i started to search a message encoder/decoder. First i started
with kaitai-structs, but after a while i noticed that kaitai-struct is not provide encoder function. Then i found sbe
and sbe provides me both encoder and decoder functionality.

Simple version of usage of netty with sbe is now completed. Next work on the project will be adding more messages to
both client and server.

With next update, will also add more wiki-pages to explain this project step by step, and will going to complete all
comments on source code. Regards.
